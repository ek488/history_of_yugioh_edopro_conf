# history_of_yugioh_edopro_conf

This creates .conf files for EDOPro (https://projectignis.github.io/) that only include products that were released before a certain date and with the appropriate banlist for that time period.

Copy the .conf files in /history_of_yugioh_edopro_conf/EDOPRO_conf/ into /ProjectIgnis/lflists/ . The .conf files are labeled according to this The History of Yu-Gi-Oh! series on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpAqSYsFkgvsOKDAAEzj4dCIAfFjwtY0y).

Thank you to [YGOPRODeck](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/) for providing product data.
